# RÃ¹nagfile to configure a workstation

ðŸ§¡ A script to deploy a workstation.

* It could be run on a freshly installed Linux, MacOS, or Windows.
* It installs and configures software, credentials, and backups.
* It is idempotent, it could be run multiple times to produce up-to date configuration.

I have made some effort to ensure that this script does not contain personal identifiable information. All such information is stored in the [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) database, which is imported from external media when deploying a workstation.

There is a library, [ðŸ’œ RÃ¹nag](https://github.com/runag/runag), that allows the code here to be declarative and concise.

## Deploy workstation on Linux

```sh
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runag/runag/main/deploy.sh) add runag/workstation-runagfile run
```


## Deploy workstation on Linux in KVM (useful for testing)

**On host machine**

This step will copy your `~/.password-store` and `~/.gnupg` keys to `~/.runag/.virt-deploy-keys` directory, and after consecutive steps your keys will be accessible from the guest machine. Please make sure you understand implications of that.

```
mkdir ~/.runag/.virt-deploy-keys
runag workstation::linux::deploy_virt_keys
```

**In virt-manager**

1. Enable shared memory

2. Create Filesystem

```
Driver: virtiofs
Source path: ~/.runag # replace ~ with absolute path!
Target path: runag
```

**On guest machine**

```sh
sudo mount -m -t virtiofs runag ~/.runag
~/.runag/bin/runag
```

**Modify `/etc/fstab` if you want to keep `.runag` mount after reboot**

```sh
# /etc/fstab

# replace ~ with absolute path!
runag  ~/.runag  virtiofs  defaults  0  0
```

## Deploy workstation on MacOS 

```sh
bash <(curl -Ssf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runag/runag/main/deploy.sh) add runag/workstation-runagfile run
```


## Deploy workstation on Windows 

### 1. First stage deploy script (in powershell)

Start PowerShell as administrator, run the following and wait for it to complete:

```sh
iwr -UseBasicParsing "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runag/workstation-runagfile/main/deploy.ps1" | iex
```

### 2. Second stage deploy script (in bash)

At this point, Git Bash should be installed by the first script. Start Git Bash as your regular user and run the following:

```sh
~/.runag/bin/runag
```

Select things that you need from the task list.


## Deploy tidy machine on Windows 

Start PowerShell as administrator, run the following and wait for it to complete:

```sh
iwr -UseBasicParsing "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runag/workstation-runagfile/main/deploy-tidy.ps1" | iex
```


## Password Store

### Generate and save SSH key to the password store

```sh
# Fill this
ssh_keyfile="id_ed25519"
ssh_comment=""
ssh_passphrase=""
pass_path="identity/my/ssh"

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "${ssh_comment}" -f "${ssh_keyfile}" -N "${ssh_passphrase}"

{ echo "${ssh_passphrase}"; cat "${ssh_keyfile}"; } | pass insert --multiline "${pass_path}/${ssh_keyfile}"
pass insert --multiline "${pass_path}/${ssh_keyfile}.pub" <"${ssh_keyfile}.pub"
```

You may wish to change some paths:

1. This [README](README.md) file, `runag/workstation-runagfile` and maybe `runag/runag` if you forked it as well.
2. In [deploy.ps1](deploy.ps1), find "If you forked this".
