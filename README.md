# ðŸšž Sopkafile to configure my workstation

A script to configure my workstation. I run it on a freshly installed Linux, MacOS, or Windows.

It will do the following:

1. Installs the basic software I frequently use.
2. Installs keys and software licenses from my bitwarden database.
3. Makes a few tweaks to the system and to the desktop software.
4. Installs a few shell aliases.
5. Installs configuration for the Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code (there is also a script to keep configuration in the repository up to date with the local changes).

This script is idempotent. It can be run multiple times to produce a system which is up-to date with the recent software updates and with my configuration changes.

The file ``config.sh`` contains my name and email to use in configuration. Please remove them if you happen to fork this script.

## Linux

```sh
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/senotrusov/sopka/main/deploy.sh) \
senotrusov/sopkafile
```

## MacOS

```sh
bash <(curl -Ssf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/senotrusov/sopka/main/deploy.sh) \
senotrusov/sopkafile
```

## Windows

1. Start PowerShell as administrator, run the following and wait for it to complete:

```sh
iwr -UseBasicParsing "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/senotrusov/sopkafile/main/deploy.ps1" | iex
```

2. At this point, Git Bash should be installed by the first script. Start Git Bash as your regular user and run the following:

```sh
~/.sopka/bin/sopka
```

3. Start PowerShell as a regular user, and make sure you really understand consequences of the next command before you run it:

```sh
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```

## Secret items which are expected to be found in a Bitwarden

Record names should be as the following:

<!-- # bitwarden-object: see list below -->

```
"my github personal access token"
"my microsoft account"
"my password for ssh private key"
"my ssh private key"
"my ssh public key"
"my tailscale reusable key"
"sublime text 3 license"
```
