# ðŸšž Sopkafile to configure my workstation

A script to configure my workstation. I run it on a freshly installed Linux, MacOS, or Windows.

It will do the following:

1. Installs the basic software I frequently use.
2. Installs my keys, passwords, software licenses (I keep them in the bitwarden database)
	* Puts SSH keys to the filesystem and passwords to the linux keychain.
3. Makes a few tweaks to the system and to the desktop software.
4. Installs a few shell aliases.
5. Installs configuration for the Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code (there is also a script to keep configuration in the repository up to date with the local changes).

This script is idempotent. It can be run multiple times to produce a system which is up-to date with the recent software updates and with my configuration changes.

The file ``config.sh`` contains my name and email to use in configuration. If you'll fork this script, please remove them.

## Linux

```sh
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/senotrusov/sopkafile/main/deploy.sh)
```

## MacOS

```sh
bash <(curl -Ssf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/senotrusov/sopkafile/main/deploy.sh)
```

## Windows

1. Start PowerShell as administrator, run the following and wait for it to complete:

```sh
iwr -UseBasicParsing "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/senotrusov/sopkafile/main/deploy.ps1" | iex
```

2. At this point, Git Bash should be installed by the first script. Start Git Bash (regularly, as your user), and run the following:

```sh
~/.sopka/bin/sopka
```

## Secret items which are expected to be found in a Bitwarden

Record names should be as the following:

<!-- # bitwarden-object: see list below -->

```
"my borg storage ssh private key"
"my borg storage ssh public key"
"my github personal access token"
"my microsoft account"
"my password for ssh private key"
"my ssh private key"
"my ssh public key"
"stan-documents backup passphrase"
"stan-documents backup storage"
"sublime text 3 license"
```
