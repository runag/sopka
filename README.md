# ðŸšž Runagfile to configure my workstation

A collection of scripts to deploy my workstation. I hope other people may find them useful.

I run them on a freshly installed Linux, MacOS, or Windows to install and configure software and credentials. Scripts are idempotent, they could be run multiple times. There is also a library, [Runag](https://github.com/senotrusov/sopka), that helps this scripts to look nice and declarative.

## Deploy workstation on Linux

```sh
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/senotrusov/sopka/main/deploy.sh) add senotrusov/workstation-sopkafile run
```


## Deploy workstation on MacOS 

```sh
bash <(curl -Ssf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/senotrusov/sopka/main/deploy.sh) add senotrusov/workstation-sopkafile run
```


## Deploy workstation on Windows 

### 1. First stage deploy script (in powershell)

Start PowerShell as administrator, run the following and wait for it to complete:

```sh
iwr -UseBasicParsing "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/senotrusov/workstation-sopkafile/main/deploy.ps1" | iex
```

That script will do the following:

1. Installs chocolatey
2. Installs git
3. Clones [sopka](https://github.com/senotrusov/sopka) and [workstation-sopkafile](https://github.com/senotrusov/workstation-sopkafile) repositories
4. Installs packages from those lists:
    * [bare-metal-desktop.config](lib/choco/bare-metal-desktop.config) (if not in virtual machine)
    * [developer-tools.config](lib/choco/developer-tools.config) (you will be asked if it's needed)
    * [basic-tools.config](lib/choco/basic-tools.config)
7. Upgrades all installed choco packages
8. Sets ssh-agent service startup type to automatic and runs it
9. Installs MSYS2 and MINGW development toolchain for use in ruby's gems compilation
10. Installs my lovely file-digests gem
11. Install pass (by pacman) and symlinks to it

### 2. Second stage deploy script (in bash)

At this point, Git Bash should be installed by the first script. Start Git Bash as your regular user and run the following:

```sh
~/.sopka/bin/sopka
```

Select from menu things that you need.
