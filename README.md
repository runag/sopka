# ðŸšž Sopkafile to configure my workstation

A script to configure my workstation. I run it on a freshly installed Linux, MacOS, or Windows.

This script helps me to configure my workstation, but it's rather generic and could also be useful for other people.

Still, it contains steps which are of personal preference and needs.

To keep those steps as declarative as I could possible express in Bash, I made a separate library [Sopka](https://github.com/senotrusov/sopka).

Basically, this Sopkafile you are looking at is the things I want to setup and configure for that exact task (my workstation) and [Sopka](https://github.com/senotrusov/sopka) is the abstract library that makes it all possible.

## What this script will do

1. Installs the basic software I frequently use.
2. Installs keys and software licenses from my bitwarden database.
3. Makes a few tweaks to the system and to the desktop software.
4. Installs a few shell aliases.
5. Installs configuration for the Sublime Text, Sublime Merge and Visual Studio Code (there is also a script to keep configuration in the repository up to date with the local changes).

This script is idempotent. It can be run multiple times to produce a system which is up-to date with the recent software updates and with my configuration changes.

The file ``config.sh`` contains my name, email, and PGP key IDs to use in configuration. Please remove them if you happen to fork this script.

## How to run it on Linux

### Option A: if you have a console with scrollbuffer

```sh
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/senotrusov/sopka/main/deploy.sh) add senotrusov/workstation-sopkafile run
```

### Option B: run deploy-vm-server on console without scroll buffer

```sh
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/senotrusov/sopka/main/deploy.sh) add senotrusov/workstation-sopkafile run ubuntu_workstation::deploy_vm_server 2>&1 | tee -a deploy-vm-server.log
```

## How to run it on MacOS

```sh
bash <(curl -Ssf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/senotrusov/sopka/main/deploy.sh) add senotrusov/workstation-sopkafile run
```

## How to run it on on Windows

### 1. First stage deploy script (in powershell)

Start PowerShell as administrator, run the following and wait for it to complete:

```sh
iwr -UseBasicParsing "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/senotrusov/workstation-sopkafile/main/deploy.ps1" | iex
```

That script will do the following:

1. Installs chocolatey
2. Installs git
3. Clones [sopka](https://github.com/senotrusov/sopka) and [workstation-sopkafile](https://github.com/senotrusov/workstation-sopkafile) repositories
4. Installs packages from those lists:
    * [bare-metal-desktop.config](lib/choco/bare-metal-desktop.config) (if not in virtual machine)
    * [developer-tools.config](lib/choco/developer-tools.config) (you will be asked if it's needed)
    * [basic-tools.config](lib/choco/basic-tools.config)
7. Upgrades all installed choco packages
8. Sets ssh-agent service startup type to automatic and runs in

### 2. Second stage deploy script (in bash)

At this point, Git Bash should be installed by the first script. Start Git Bash as your regular user and run the following:

```sh
~/.sopka/bin/sopka
```

Select ``windows_workstation::deploy_full_workstation``. It will do the following:

1. Installs shellrc loader
2. Selects nano as default editor
3. Adds sopka to PATH
4. Configures git, vscode, sublime merge, sublime text
5. Installs ssh keys, rubygems and npm credentials

### 3. Set execution policy to "Bypass"

Start PowerShell as a regular user, and make sure you really understand consequences of the next command before you run it:

```sh
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```

### 4. Install winssh-pageant

https://github.com/ndbeals/winssh-pageant

## Forking

0. Consider forking [workstation-thin-sopkafile](https://github.com/senotrusov/workstation-thin-sopkafile) instead of this
1. Go to [deploy.ps1](deploy.ps1) and find "If you forked this script"
2. Go to [config.sh](config.sh) and change things
