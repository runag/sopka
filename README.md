# RÃ¹nagfile to configure a workstation

ðŸ§¡ A script to deploy a workstation.

* It could be run on a freshly installed Linux, MacOS, or Windows.
* It installs and configures software, credentials, and backups.
* It is idempotent, it could be run multiple times to produce up-to date configuration.

I have made some effort to ensure that this script does not contain personal identifiable information. All such information is stored in the [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) database, which is imported from external media when deploying a workstation.

There is a library, [ðŸ’œ RÃ¹nag](https://github.com/runag/runag), that allows the code here to be declarative and concise.

## Deploy workstation on Linux

```sh
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runag/runag/main/deploy.sh) add runag/workstation-runagfile run
```


## Deploy workstation on MacOS 

```sh
bash <(curl -Ssf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runag/runag/main/deploy.sh) add runag/workstation-runagfile run
```


## Deploy workstation on Windows 

### 1. First stage deploy script (in powershell)

Start PowerShell as administrator, run the following and wait for it to complete:

```sh
iwr -UseBasicParsing "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runag/workstation-runagfile/main/deploy.ps1" | iex
```

That script will do the following:

> 1. Installs chocolatey
> 2. Installs git
> 3. Clones [rÃ¹nag](https://github.com/runag/runag) and [workstation rÃ¹nagfile](https://github.com/runag/workstation-runagfile) repositories
> 4. Installs packages from those lists:
>    * [bare-metal-desktop.config](lib/choco/bare-metal-desktop.config) (if not in virtual machine)
>    * [developer-tools.config](lib/choco/developer-tools.config) (you will be asked if it's needed)
>    * [basic-tools.config](lib/choco/basic-tools.config)
> 7. Upgrades all installed choco packages
> 8. Sets ssh-agent service startup type to automatic and runs it
> 9. Installs MSYS2 and MINGW development toolchain for use in ruby's gems compilation
> 11. Installs pass (by pacman) and makes a symlink to it

### 2. Second stage deploy script (in bash)

At this point, Git Bash should be installed by the first script. Start Git Bash as your regular user and run the following:

```sh
~/.runag/bin/runag
```

Select from menu things that you need.


## Deploy tidy machine on Windows 

Start PowerShell as administrator, run the following and wait for it to complete:

```sh
iwr -UseBasicParsing "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runag/workstation-runagfile/main/deploy-tidy.ps1" | iex
```

### Generate and save SSH key to the password store

```sh
# Fill this
ssh_keyfile="id_ed25519"
ssh_comment=""
ssh_passphrase=""
pass_path="identity/my/ssh"

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "${ssh_comment}" -f "${ssh_keyfile}" -N "${ssh_passphrase}"

{ echo "${ssh_passphrase}"; cat "${ssh_keyfile}"; } | pass insert --multiline "${pass_path}/${ssh_keyfile}"
pass insert --multiline "${pass_path}/${ssh_keyfile}.pub" <"${ssh_keyfile}.pub"
```

You may wish to change some paths:

1. This [README](README.md) file, `runag/workstation-runagfile` and maybe `runag/runag` if you forked it as well.
2. In [deploy.ps1](deploy.ps1), find "If you forked this".
