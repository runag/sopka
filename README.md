# My computer deploy

A script to deploy my workstation on a freshly installed Linux or MacOS. Basically I run one command and after that my workstation is fully configured for me to use.

The script will do the following:

1. Installs the basic software I frequently use.
2. Installs my keys, passwords, software licenses. I keep them in the bitwarden database, this script puts SSH keys to the filesystem and passwords to the linux keychain, so I could connect to my remote servers and commit to my git repositories without entering any extra passwords besides system login one. Also this script enables gnome keyring access in TTY sessions to ease the use of SSH keys and git credentials in Sway WM.
3. Makes a few tweaks to the system and to the desktop software.
4. Installs a few shell aliases.
5. Installs configuration for the Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code. It also can put that configuration back from the workstation to the repository in case I changed it locally.
6. With an extra environment flag DEPLOY_SWAY it installs Sway WM, my Sway configuration and few related software packages.

This script is idempotent, so it can be run multiple times to produce a system which is up-to date with the recent software updates and my configuration changes.

The file ``config.sh`` contains my name and email to use in configuration. In the unlikely event someone will fork that script to configure his own computer this is where you could put your name and email.
